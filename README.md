Beach Resorts for rent

This is a hotel reservation website that displays the current available rooms for rent. It has two pages, Home and Rooms. 
The Home page gives information on the services provided at the resort and also its featured rooms. 

The Rooms page lists all the available rooms and has filtering options available which are price, room size, room type, number of guests, breakfast and pets. By clicking on a room the customer is redirected to the individual room's page where it showcases its features, has a description of the room and some photos of the room as well. 

The website's navigation and state management was handled with React Router and React Context API. All the data of the website is hosted on Contentful and is retrieved through its API. Moreover, the website was created using React.js.
